# ML-Lab-02---Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Libraries-Part:02
Exploring Machine Learning Series

## Lab Overview  
### Objectives

- PART 1 - EXPLORATION
- Explore the below subparts of the module sklearn
   - a. train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
   - b. make_classification and load_iris from sklearn.datasets
   - c. make_regression and load_boston from sklearn.datasets
   - d. DummyClassifier and DummyRegressor from sklearn.dummy
   - e. accuracy_score, classification_report, and confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics

- PART 2 - Questions
   - What are the different parameters of the above functions/methods that are part of the above SKLearn modules?
   - What is the effect, when you modify certain parameters that are present in the same?
   - How to get different train and test datasets?
   - Identify which are features and which are targets in Part 1b, and Part 1c (make_classification and make_regression would    depend on your inputs on the function call)
   - Identify what the things mentioned in Part 1d stands for. 
   - Making use of Part 1d, explore the various options available under Part 1e.
   - Do the documentation properly and find out answers to the above-mentioned questions.
   - Justify your findings by making use of Pandas and MatplotLibrary.
